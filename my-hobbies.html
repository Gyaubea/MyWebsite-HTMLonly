    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Reading</li>
            <ul><li>Was a novel lover <em><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/">(wattpad was hot!)</a></em> but boy, your girl needed to grow. So here I am loving self-help books, business books and general insightful reads.</li></ul>
        <li>Music</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Music makes my soul sings. It keeps it calm or thoughtful depending on the circumstance. But most significantly, music is a language of my soul.</li>
                <li>Everything music, count me in. I don't guarantee active involvement though. I just blend with both passive and active. So yeah,my love for this category ranges from the musical instrument to songwriting to singing to creating musical websites. Oh yeah, the last point is very necessary. Call me the fullstack developer!</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Writing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Let's just say I'm an invisible writer (laughs). Well, I'm gonna be a certified author one day. For now, I'm just tryna build content by trying out new things and learning passionately in order to find my niche and be the full a** expressionist I gotta be. </li>
                <li>My current write-ups? Unfortunately, I haven't got much. Just some occasional journaling and that habors less interesting stuff too; just my "moody days" vents. So how is writing a hobby? Well, I enjoy writing. It's just that I mostly have this stubborn notion that it's a waste of time. And that, I could be learning with that time. Funny right?</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Time with Luz</li>
            <ul><li>I love being with him; both virtually and physically</li></ul>
        <li>Family</li>
            <ul><li>As the saying goes; Family is everything!</li></ul>
    </ol>
